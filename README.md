# Winx Club Profile
This application takes a dive into the profiles and characteristics of the main protagonists of the Italian cartoon, WInx CLub. In this application you are able to choose from the main five and explore where their powers come from and the many different abilities they accquire. 

## Motivation
This show was one of my all time favorite cartoons growing up. It is really interesting the way show creator Ignio Straffi is able to create many unique characters that balance each other's personalities so well. It is interesting to see the different magical abilities that each protagonist controls. It ignites the creativity inside other kids, including myself, to create their own fairy and their own magic. 

## Install
